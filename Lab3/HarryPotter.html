        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p style = "font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">The life of ten-year-old Harry Potter is not sweet: his parents died when he was one year old, and his uncle and aunt, who took in an orphan, receive nothing but slaps and scuffs. But on Harry's eleventh birthday, everything changes. A strange visitor, who suddenly appeared on the doorstep, brings a letter, from which the boy learns that he is in fact a purebred wizard, and adopted by Hogwarts - the school of magic. And in a couple of weeks Harry will be rushing on the Hogwarts Express train towards a new life, where incredible adventures, true friends and the most important - the key to solving the mystery of his parents' death await him.</p>
