                Harry Potter - in the book, the hero appears as a short, thin teenager, short for his 11 years.

                Harry is wearing the clothes of his cousin, Dudley, a squabbling, fat egomaniac.

                Hermione Granger - loves her studies and devotes a lot of time to them. Sometimes she can be too arrogant and overly proud of her academic achievements. 
                She is ambitious, always tries to answer first in class and stands out with her knowledge, for which many people not unreasonably consider her a "know-it-all" and a "nerd".
